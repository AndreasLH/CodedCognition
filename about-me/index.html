To this day I still think about if it could be possible to create that start-up, maybe one day!</p><p>I was really at the Master&rsquo;s in 2022 that I found a particular interest for computer vision, specifically deep learning computer vision methods. Eventually I also went on to do my thesis on a hyperfocused deep learning computer vision topic. Well, it&rsquo;s not so surprising considering that DTU offers many courses in this direction, so it was a natural way for me to go. And by the way also one of my biggest critiques of the course catalogue: the fact there are no courses on language modelling and transformer methods is a huge miss from DTU&rsquo;s side. I personally find it quite dissapointing that I only ever had 2 lectures on transformers in my entire uni time. This lack of courses led me to seek out special courses, which I found to be a great way to get more specialised skills that make me stand out more from other students. Otherwise, I honestly found the master&rsquo;s degree to be extremely underwhelming, considering how good the bachelors was. I had several courses that I did not learn anything, or close to nothing, from because I already it all. On the other hand, I found the thesis period to be one of the best times, although also the period where I worked the hardest - because I liked it so much 😀.</p><figure><img src=/CodedCognition/about-me/degree.png width=60%><figcaption><h4>Me and Lukas after finishing our Master's Thesis at DTU.</h4></figcaption></figure><h1 id=joining-copenhagen-medtech>Joining Copenhagen Medtech</h1><p>At the start of 2024 (the final semester of my education) I decided to join Copenhagen Medtech, a volunteer student organisation making events trying to bring medicine students and technical students (like me!) together. I was personally intrigued after attending an innovation the year before. I was drawn to the organisation because I liked the whole part about collaborating with other students who are quite different from the people who I meet daily. I have previously attended many events of different character, so I find it very appealing to also organise some myself. I think it provides a lot more opportunities than one might superficially consider. Furthermore, I have also gained a lot of new gratifying friends and experience during the process.</p><figure><img src=/CodedCognition/about-me/medtech.png width=70%><figcaption><h4>Me and a part of the Medtech team after one of our events at Rigshospitalet</h4></figcaption></figure><h1 id=my-uni-courses>My uni courses</h1><p>A comprehensive list of the courses I took during University.
