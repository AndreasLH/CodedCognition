My personal website. The page demonstrates some of the projects have worked on, structured like a blog.

It uses the [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) template and [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

GitHub action has been set up to deploy the theme to a public GitHub page automatically. Also, there's a cron job to update the theme automatically everyday.
